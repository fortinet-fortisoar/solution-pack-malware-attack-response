# Usage

Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/solution-pack-guide.md) to understand how to simulate and reset scenarios. 
 
To understand the process FortiSOAR follows to respond to malware alert using Symantec EDR, we have included a scenario &mdash; **Malware Response Using Symantec Solutions** with this solution pack. Refer to the section *Malware Response Using Symantec Solutions* to understand how this solution pack automation addresses your needs.

## Malware Response Using Symantec Solutions

This scenario generates an example alert of Type *Malware* in FortiSOAR's **Alerts** module. 

Navigate to the created example alert and note the following: 

- Asset details like Device UID and File Hash.
- Source IP and Destination IP

Select the alert and launch the playbook **Investigate Malware Response (Symantec EDR / ATP / CloudSOC)** to perform following automated tasks:

- Get file Reputation using Symantec DeepSight Intelligence
- Delete the malicious file hashes from the device using Symantec ATP
- Isolate the device using Symantec ATP
- Block the User in Symantec CloudSOC
- Isolate asset due to malware infection
